# CSCI 311 - DNA Sequencing Project
### Team 7: Hunter Gehman, Geoffrey Gaines, Geoffrey Park, Alex Coleman-Ivenitsky

**For the purposes of running our code, we have provided the below instructions. This will allow anyone who downloads the files to compare the various computational algorithms against one another.**

Step 1: Download the files / clone the repository and save into a folder where you will remember their place. 

Step 2: Open 'DNASequenceAnalysis.java' into the IDE you are most familiar with.

Step 3: Execute the main file. Compile / build first if necessary, but many IDEs will take care of this for you. Gradle has been included in the repository to help with this.

Step 4: Follow the text-based prompts and provide the input. Files that are input should be in the FASTA format, as is standard in bioinformatics. The algorithms will be from the list of four algorithms that we have implemented. A few example files are available in the 'resources' subfolder. Add personal FASTA query and database files there if you desire to test them as well. 

Step 5: Repeat for different files and different algorithms as many times as desired. Enter the specified exit character when you desire to exit the program.
